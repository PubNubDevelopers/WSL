## 🎯 Q&A TALKING POINTS

### **Technical Questions**

**Q: "How does the translation function scale?"**
A: "PubNub Functions auto-scale. Each message triggers independently, handling thousands of translations per second with zero server management."

**Q: "What about translation costs?"**  
A: "Demo uses Google Translate API. Production could use AWS Translate, Azure Cognitive Services, or cache common phrases in PubNub's KV store."

**Q: "How secure are the private watch parties?"**
A: "Each party gets a unique PubNub channel with access controls. Only invited members can join, and all messages are encrypted in transit."

**Q: "Can this handle real video processing?"**
A: "Absolutely. The clip creator demonstrates the workflow. Production would integrate with AWS MediaConvert, FFmpeg, or similar video processing services."

### **Business Questions**

**Q: "How long did this take to build?"**
A: "Week 2 features took 3 days using PubNub's platform. Traditional infrastructure would take weeks or months."

**Q: "What's the user capacity?"**
A: "PubNub handles millions of concurrent users. This WSL demo could scale to handle the entire global surf community."

**Q: "How much does this cost to run?"**
A: "PubNub pricing is usage-based. Small communities start at $49/month, enterprise scales with volume discounts."
