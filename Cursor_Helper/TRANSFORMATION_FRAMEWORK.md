# Demo Transformation Framework

## Overview
This framework provides a structured approach to transforming the PubNub Live Events Demo into new demo applications while leveraging the existing architecture and PubNub integrations.

## Transformation Strategy

### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis
Before beginning any transformation, complete these steps:

1. **Define New Demo Purpose**
   - What industry/use case are you targeting?
   - What specific PubNub features do you want to showcase?
   - Who is the target audience?

2. **Identify Reusable Components**
   - Which existing widgets can be adapted?
   - What backend data structures can be repurposed?
   - Which PubNub channels/features transfer directly?

3. **Determine New Requirements**
   - What new widgets/components are needed?
   - What new data schemas are required?
   - What additional PubNub features should be integrated?

### Phase 2: Architecture Planning

#### Widget Mapping Exercise
Create a mapping from current widgets to new requirements:

**Current Widgets:**
- ChatWidget → Can be adapted for any real-time communication
- StreamWidget → Can become any media/content widget
- PollsWidget → Flexible for any voting/survey needs
- MatchStatsWidget → Can display any type of live data/metrics
- AdvertsWidget → Universal for monetization features
- BotWidget → Adaptable for any automated assistance
- LiveCommentaryWidget → Can provide narration for any live content

**Adaptation Strategies:**
- **Direct Reuse**: Widget works as-is with minor styling changes
- **Data Schema Change**: Same UI, different data structure
- **UI Modification**: Same functionality, different visual design
- **Complete Replacement**: New widget needed for new functionality

### Phase 3: Data Flow Design

#### Channel Architecture Planning
Map existing channels to new use cases:

**Current Pattern**: `game.{feature}`
**New Pattern**: `{domain}.{feature}` (e.g., `concert.chat`, `webinar.polls`)

#### Backend Data Simulation
The current system simulates a sports match timeline. Plan your new timeline:
- What events happen over time?
- What triggers user interactions?
- What data needs to be synchronized?

## Transformation Templates

### Use Case Template: Concert/Music Event Demo

**Adaptation Plan:**
- **ChatWidget**: Music fan discussions, artist mentions
- **StreamWidget**: Live concert stream with artist reactions
- **PollsWidget**: Song requests, favorite artist polls
- **MatchStatsWidget** → **ConcertStatsWidget**: Live attendance, song stats
- **AdvertsWidget**: Merchandise, ticket upsells
- **BotWidget**: Concert info, artist facts
- **LiveCommentaryWidget** → **DJCommentaryWidget**: DJ announcements, song info

**New Data Schema:**
```javascript
// Instead of match events, concert events
{
  "timeSinceStreamStartInMs": 30000,
  "eventType": "songStart",
  "data": {
    "songTitle": "Bohemian Rhapsody",
    "artist": "Queen",
    "duration": 355000
  }
}
```

### Use Case Template: Educational Webinar Demo

**Adaptation Plan:**
- **ChatWidget**: Student Q&A, discussion
- **StreamWidget** → **PresentationWidget**: Slides and video
- **PollsWidget**: Knowledge checks, feedback polls
- **MatchStatsWidget** → **LearningStatsWidget**: Attendance, engagement metrics
- **AdvertsWidget** → **CoursePromotionWidget**: Related courses, certifications
- **BotWidget**: Educational assistant, FAQ
- **LiveCommentaryWidget** → **InstructorNotesWidget**: Additional context, tips

### Use Case Template: Financial Trading Demo

**Adaptation Plan:**
- **ChatWidget**: Trader discussions, market sentiment
- **StreamWidget** → **MarketFeedWidget**: Live market data visualization
- **PollsWidget**: Market predictions, sentiment polls
- **MatchStatsWidget** → **TradingStatsWidget**: Portfolio performance, market indicators
- **AdvertsWidget** → **TradingToolsWidget**: Premium features, tools
- **BotWidget**: Market analysis bot, trading tips
- **LiveCommentaryWidget** → **MarketCommentaryWidget**: Expert market analysis

## Step-by-Step Transformation Process

### Step 1: Environment Setup
```bash
# Create new demo branch
git checkout -b new-demo-{use-case}

# Update project naming
# - Update package.json names
# - Update README titles
# - Update environment variable names
```

### Step 2: Backend Data Transformation
```javascript
// 1. Update /backend/game-data/ files with new event data
// 2. Modify channel names in /backend/index.js
// 3. Update timeline logic for new event types
// 4. Test data generation with new schema
```

### Step 3: Frontend Component Adaptation
```typescript
// 1. Rename/adapt widgets in /web/app/widget-*/ directories
// 2. Update data interfaces and types
// 3. Modify styling and branding
// 4. Update channel subscriptions
// 5. Test real-time data flow
```

### Step 4: Visual Design Updates
```css
// 1. Update color schemes in /web/app/globals.css
// 2. Replace images in /web/public/
// 3. Update logos and branding elements
// 4. Modify layout components as needed
```

### Step 5: Testing & Validation
- Test all real-time features
- Verify cross-device compatibility
- Check PubNub feature integration
- Validate data synchronization
