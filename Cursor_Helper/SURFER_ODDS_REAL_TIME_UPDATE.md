## ✅ **Now Fully Functional!**

Your SurferOddsWidget **now updates in real-time** just like all other demo elements! Here's what I've implemented:

## 🔧 **Implementation Details**

### **Backend Simulation**
- **Created**: `/backend/game-data/surfer-odds.js` 
- **Integrated**: Into main timeline system (`index.js`)
- **Channels**: Three real-time PubNub channels:
  - `wsl.surfer-odds` - Win rate percentages and form updates
  - `wsl.surf-conditions` - Wave conditions and difficulty changes  
  - `wsl.bet-odds-asd` - Live betting odds from "Alt Sports Data"

### **Real-Time Events (Demo Timeline)**
| Time | Event | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 3s | Odds Update | Griffin trending up (73% → 75%) |
| 4s | ASD Betting | Griffin odds improve (+120 → +110) |
| 7s | Conditions | Waves increase (6-8ft → 8-10ft, quality 8 → 9) |
| 8s | Market Shake-up | Kelly jumps (65% → 70%), Carissa drops |
| 9s | Betting Lines | Major line movements across all surfers |
| 12s | Hot Streak | John John catches fire (68% → 72%) |
| 13s | Market Response | John John becomes co-favorite |
| 16s | Wind Change | Conditions deteriorate (offshore → cross-shore) |
| 17s | Final Adjust | Italo rises, Griffin adjusts for wind |
| 18s | Market Close | All odds stabilize for event start |
